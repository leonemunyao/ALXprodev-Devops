### Task 0: API Request Automation.

The objective is to automate the process of making API requests to the Pokemon API and saving the result to a file.

* Writing a shell script that makes a request to the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/) and retrieves data for a specific Pokemon Pikachu. It should save the response to a json  file: `data.json` and if the request fails , it should log the error to an error file: `errors.txt`.
